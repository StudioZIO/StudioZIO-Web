/* StudioZIO Early Access sign-up.

   The form posts natively to Buttondown -- its embed endpoint must be a form
   action, not a fetch -- so this file never takes the submit over. It only
   reports the one fact worth measuring, and tells the visitor what happens
   next, once the browser has accepted the form as valid (a submit event does
   not fire for a form that fails its own validation, so a click on an empty
   form is not counted as a sign-up).

   With JavaScript off the form still posts; only the event and the status
   line are lost. gtag sends over sendBeacon, which survives the navigation to
   Buttondown's confirmation page. Consent is enforced by the tag itself. */
