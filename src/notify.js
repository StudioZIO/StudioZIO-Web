/* ZIO MixRack "notify me" submission.

   Same two constraints as src/contact.js, for the same reasons: the site is
   served under `form-action 'none'`, so a native POST is refused — a plain
   <form action="..."> would render, validate, submit, and silently go
   nowhere — and the only way out of the page is a fetch to the one endpoint
   `connect-src` allows. The markup therefore carries no action attribute at
   all, so there is no form that looks submittable but is not.

   Kept as its own file rather than folded into contact.js: the build copies
   plain classic scripts (see build.mjs) with no bundler and no module graph,
   so sharing a helper would mean either shipping a module or making the
   support form depend on a file the MixRack page also loads. Two small
   self-contained files is the cheaper trade here; validate.mjs asserts both
   stay in step on the parts that matter.

   Progressive by construction: with JS off nothing submits, and the page says
   so instead of pretending a signup was recorded. */
