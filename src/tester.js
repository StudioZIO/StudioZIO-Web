/* StudioZIO MixRack tester-interest submission.

   Same two constraints as src/notify.js, for the same reasons: the site is
   served under `form-action 'none'`, so a native POST is refused — a plain
   <form action="..."> would render, validate, submit, and silently go
   nowhere — and the only way out of the page is a fetch to the one endpoint
   `connect-src` allows. The markup therefore carries no action attribute at
   all, so there is no form that looks submittable but is not.

   Kept as its own file rather than folded into notify.js: the two forms
   collect different fields, post a different `intent`, and report a
   different GA4 event, and the build copies plain classic scripts with no
   bundler and no module graph — so sharing a helper would mean either
   shipping a module or making one form's script depend on the other's DOM.
   validate.mjs asserts both stay in step on the parts that matter, same as
   notify.js and contact.js.

   Progressive by construction: with JS off nothing submits, and the page
   says so instead of pretending interest was recorded. */
